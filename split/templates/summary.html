        <p>Our machine brains are still babies, we are working on them!
        You can help us by signing up to test the alpha release. :)</p>

        <p>We also show you the original text that was fed to the internal
        sumamrization engine. Right now we are using a compression factor of 3
        i.e., we will try to make your text thrice as short. The next release will
        allow you to set this factor yourself.</p>
